Features

Real-time Focus Detection: Monitors if the candidate is attentive and looking at the screen.

Face Detection: Detects presence/absence of a face and flags multiple faces in the frame.

Object Detection: Identifies suspicious items such as mobile phones, books, and other unauthorized devices.

Integrity Scoring: Computes a final integrity score based on deductions for detected suspicious events.

Detailed Reports: Generates comprehensive proctoring reports summarizing the session and logged events.

Tech Stack

Frontend

React 18 with Vite

TensorFlow.js for object detection

MediaPipe for face mesh detection

React Webcam for camera access
